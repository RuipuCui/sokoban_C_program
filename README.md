 find the path traversing the Sokoban Graph from the initial state (vertex) 
 leading to a state (vertex) where all the boxes are located on a storage area. 
 The best path is the shortest path. A path is a sequence of movements.  
 Use Dijkstra to find the shortest path first, along with some game-specific optimizations to speed up your algorithm.

 i complete the algorithm (the findsolution function in the file ai.c). Thanks the framework provided by university of melbourne.
